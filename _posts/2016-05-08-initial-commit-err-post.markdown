So I've been playing around with some [HashiCorp][hashicorp] software the last week, namely [Nomad][nomad] and [Consul][consul], and I started reading SÃ©bastien Goasguen's [Docker Cookbook][cookbook] to learn more about Docker. Kinda late to the docker party, I know.

Anyway, this all got me to want to put some writing down. Also partly to finally get rid of that "Welcome to nginx!" that has been sitting at [http://vanduuren.xyz](http://vanduuren.xyz) for a while now.
Thanks go out to [Nick Balestra][nick_balestra] for publishing his excellent MIT-licensed [Kactus][kactus] theme on Github.
